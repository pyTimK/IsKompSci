You will learn about the basic data types such as integers, strings, floats, and lists. Additionally, you will be introduced to the types of operations you can perform with these data types.\n\nYou will also learn about the different tools that will help you structure your programs. This includes conditional statements, iterations with for loops and while loops, functions, and recursion. \n\nLastly, you will tackle object-oriented programming, a programming paradigm that will help prepare you for making widescale projects in the future.",

It is a math-intensive course, however, it separates itself from the calculation and number crunching mathematics we know.\n\nComputer science is an application of pure mathematics, which revolves around proving ideas given a set of axioms, or statements that are universally considered true. You will learn about these proving techniques so that you can later use them to prove ideas in computer science, such as the efficiency of an algorithm or if a problem is in fact solvable by a computer.\n\nSome topics you will encounter in this course include logical statements, proof techniques, set theory, and group theory.",
